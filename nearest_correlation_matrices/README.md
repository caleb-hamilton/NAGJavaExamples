# Nearest Correlation Matrices

This file looks at computing *nearest correlation matrices* using the NAG Library for *Java*.

## Correlation Matrices

* A *n* by *n* matrix is a correlation matrix if
    * it is symmetric
    * it has ones on the diagonal
    * its eignevalues are non-negative (positive semidefinite)
